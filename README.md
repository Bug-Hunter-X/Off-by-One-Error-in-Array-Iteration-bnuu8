This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index. The `FixedArray.java` file shows the corrected code with the for loop condition changed to prevent the error.  The bug leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime. This is a frequently encountered error in programming that highlights the importance of carefully checking loop boundaries when working with arrays.
